# about our UofT Hacks project

## Inspiration
We were inspired by the resilience of freelancers, particularly creative designers, during the pandemic. 
As students, it's easy to feel overwhelmed and not value our own work. 
We wanted to empower emerging designers and remind them of what we can do with a little bit of courage. And support.

## What it does
Bossify is a mobile app that cleverly helps students adjust their design fees.
It focuses on equitable upfront pay, which in turn increases the amount of money saved. 
This can be put towards an emergency fund. On the other side, clients can receive high-quality, reliable work. 
The platform has a transparent rating system making it easy to find quality freelancers.

It's a win-win situation.

## Mimimum viable product
Since we don't have time to create the entire app, we choose to implement the key 
feature of our app in this MVP, which is an AI algorithm that takes in consideration 
many relevant variables that factor into the price (amount the designer gets paid for the project) calculation
and splits out a reasonable price. Because it's the MVP, we have designed the user interface in a very simplistic way,
but if we were to continue this project, we would improve it tremendously according to our designs in figma [will
post the link after the hackathon is over].
